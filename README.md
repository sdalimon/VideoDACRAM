This is an adapter to add 512kB of SRAM and a simple video output to the Lattice MachXO3 starter board.

My original experiments used internal block RAM and a simple 2 resistor output that used the 75 ohm input of the TV.

As I got the resolution up the block RAM ran out, so this includes an SRAM.

The video out is now buffered and provides a proper 75 ohm output with an RCA socket.

Connect it to the J8 heade rof the dev board.
